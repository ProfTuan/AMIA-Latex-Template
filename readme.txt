Essential Files:

* amia.cls is a latex class file to produce a PDF in the format required by AMIA.

* amia.tex is a latex document which can be used as example of use of amia.cls.
  In addition, the text in this file contains details about the AMIA format requirements.

  If you use dvipdf to produce the final PDF, margins might not follow the instructions of the template.
  You are advised to use "dvipdfm -p letter" instead.

* amia.bib is the latex bibliography file
  It is important to keep the bibliography style "unsrt" so the references follow the citation order.
