\section*{Introduction}

This template should be used as a starting point for AMIA submissions.  A number of Word styles, all beginning with the word ``AMIA", are available for use in your submissions.

It is important to review the AMIA Call for Participation where types of submissions considered and general requirements for each submission type are listed. All submissions must conform to the format and presentation requirements described in the CFP and at the submission site.
